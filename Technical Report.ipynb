    "Can we predict how successful a player will be in the NBA based on data alone? \n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball analytics have been a growing trend, more models and rankings are available online, for example, 538's CARMELO model. However, every year around late June, the NBA Draft arrives, and the teams just never get it right. Top picks are wasted as hyped players turn into busts, while late sleepers way down in the draft turn into blossoming superstars (e.g. Isaiah Thomas, picked last in the draft). \n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations spend a ton of money to fly scouts around the world to identify potential top picks, and hire top analysts to predict potentially successful NBA players. When the team lands someone like Michael Jordan, the benefits are enormous. The team increases its chances to make a championship run, ticket and merchandise sales increase, and the local economy gets a boost. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and many draft picks were wasted this way (and why so many draft picks are included in trades). \n",

    "My initial goal was to incorporate basketball statistics, such as Points per Game, demographic statistics, such as the poverty level of where the player grew up, how many siblings the player had, and physical measurements, such as hand size, vertical reach. This would enable our model to have a unique and more complete understanding of each player, and hopefully produce more accurate results than other models out there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since demographic statistics are extremely difficult to compile (e.g. manually entering data from Wikipedia), I am initially approaching the problem with just basketball statistics and physical measurements. I ambitiously gathered nine sets of data from credible sources like BasketballReference, DraftExpress, RealGM, and the official site of the NBA with the goal of using basketball and physical measurement data before a player's career in the NBA to predict their NBA-level statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lead to many problems when attempting to compile the data together, for example:\n",
    "* Different sources spelling player names differently\n",
    "* Advanced physical measurements such as hand size, vertical reach, wingspan was not recorded before the year 2000\n",
    "* Players do not have to attend the Draft Combine, where all measurements are recorded\n",
    "* College basketball statistics are available only from 2003 onwards\n",
    "* International players and players who entered the NBA from highschool are excluded\n",
    "* Not all drafted players play in the NBA, and some players leave after a very short term\n",

I filtered players who were in the NBA and fit the criteria of my operationalized target, and aggregated the college data by taking the average of the statistics throughout the player's college career. To ensure I had aggregated that right player (there were many cases of players sharing the same name but attending different schools), I had to compare and manually edit names and colleges. \n",

    "My goal was to produce an ordered list where players are ranked as accurately as possible according to their skill based on advanced metrics, so that each team at each draft position will know what their return is. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders in this problem are NBA teams, primarily the team owners and GMs; individuals who have a say in the draft and in the structure of the team. From their point of view, being able to draft and sign a rookie player to a long-term extension would be the optimal outcome. This mitigates uncertainty with team structure, and allows for a peace of mind as they know to a degree of certainty what their return is from the draft. So what would be the best information for the stakeholders to have when making this decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to first take a look at how a NBA rookie contract works. Once a player is drafted, his rookie contract guarantees two years of pay, and salary is based on the position drafted. After the completion of the player's first season until October 31st, the team is allowed to exercise an option to re-sign the player for a third year. This also applies for the following year, to re-sign the player for a fourth year. Teams are also allowed to offer rookie extensions to players if they want to retain him for long-term, however, they must play out the four years of their rookie contract. If no extension is given, after the fourth year, the player becomes a Restricted Free Agent(RFA). This means he can sign a long term contract with his current team, sign an offer with another team and see if the current team matches, or sign a one year qualifying offer with the current team. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the rookie contract, it is best for teams to sign extensions as quickly as possible to retain the player and prevent other teams from offering a higher price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the outcome of a newly drafted player's first and second season gives minimal value to the team as the first two years of a rookie contract is guaranteed. Third year statistics is a possible option, as remarkable results may indicate a rising superstar, however, it has room for errors such as a player having a fluke season or the player is a late bloomer. The team also has the leverage to exercise the 3rd year option to keep the player, which is cheaper than offering an extension. This same logic applies for predicting 4th year results. This brings us to year 5, where the team has no control over the player. 5 years is a generous amount of time for a player to flourish and develop his skills, and typically is either approaching or just reached his prime. Due to these reasons, I will be using the average statistics (mitigating effect of outliers) of the first five years of a player's career in the NBA as my target variable. \n",

    "As I mentioned above, I want to create an ordered list that ranks players according to their skill, so teams will know what they're getting in return for the draft pick. I will be utilizing NBA advanced metrics to measure skill. There has always been an argument on the accuracy and validity of a single advanced metric, as most of them are comprised of box-score stats, which do not capture defense very well. For this reason, I will be using a combination of metrics to generate a single measure that encompasses more factors. \n",
