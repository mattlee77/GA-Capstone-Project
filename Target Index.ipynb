    "**The way NBA rookie contracts work is the first two years are guaranteed, and the salary is based on the position the player was drafted. After the completion of the player's first season, until October 31st, the team is able to exercise an option to re-sign the player for the third year. The team is able to exercise another option to re-sign the player for the fourth year afterwards with the same timeline. Teams are able to offer rookie extensions to players after their third year, but the player still has to play out their rookie contract. Teams sign players to extensions for security, to avoid the risk of the player leaving. Otherwise, after the end of the fourth year of the rookie contract, the player (Restricted Free Agent (RFA)) can either sign a long term contract with his current team, sign an offer with another team and see if the current team can match, or sign a one year qualifying offer with the current team.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What time period of predictions make the most sense for the stakeholders (NBA teams, owners, GMs)? They want to be able to draft a player they can sign for a long time, mitigating any uncertainties for the team. They want to avoid the circumstance where another team offers a higher salary when the player is a RFA and they have to match. Therefore the goal is find out as soon as possible whether the team should give an extension to the player, however, we also have to balance the decreasing accuracy of predicting years that are further away. No point predicting 1st or 2nd year since the rookie is guaranteed under contract. 3rd year is a good choice, as remarkable results will allow the team to sign the player as early as possible, however, it has room for error such as a player having a fluke season or is a late bloomer. The team also has the leverage to exercise the 3rd year option to keep the player. The same argument can be applied for predicting the 4th year results. This brings us to year 5, where the team has no control over the player. 5 years is a generous amount of time for a player to flourish and develop his skills, and typically is either at or approaching his prime. Compounding with the fact that the team has no control over the player, year 5 seems like the optimal year for predictions, balancing team security and prediction accuracy**"
